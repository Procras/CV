## :bowtie: Giancarlo Fabrizi

I'm a junior developer with a love and appreciation for following good development practices.

I've always had a passion for challenging myself and learning and mastering new skills. I think life-long learning is an essential part of being a developer and a successful career.

As an English teacher in a previous life, I learned to communicate and work with people from all walks of life and skill level. Adapting to a constantly changing environment has taught me to be flexible, and reach my goals with focus and determination.

After finishing Makers Academy I've decided to dive in head first into a major career change to get closer to the exciting tech scene. I'm currently looking for a role which provides the opportunity to continue progressing and growing at the incredibly rapid rate I have become accustomed to.

#### Software/Web Development & Testing

* Main Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java

#### Problem Solving

  *  Aim to simplify complex tasks/concepts by breaking them down into smaller/simpler units. I use plain English to solve a problem at an abstract level first, then translate into code, test-driving throughout the development.
  *  Use of diagrams to blueprint systems/concepts to more easily reason over them.
  *  Tackle problem solving with focus and calm; ability to take a step back and take a fresh approach whenever necessary.
  *  Scanning, identifying, diagnosing and resolving problems, errors and bugs in software.


#### Clean Code

  *  Taking pride in the code produced and constantly striving to improve it, make it more efficient and easier to understand.
  *  Designing and writing programs as interactions among functions that each perform a single well-defined function, and which have minimal side-effect interaction between them.
  *  Attention to detail, including choice of names. By carefully picking the clearest, most descriptive and least ambiguous name possible, the user experience is made simpler and more efficient.


#### Communication

  * Coordinating with team members and peers, with clarity and purpose, to efficiently develop the product on time.
  * Clear and frank discussion of technical options with team members and colleagues, ensuring that instructions and feedback are followed and shared.
  * Promoting better technology options to promote more efficient productivity and better working habits among team members.
