## Skills

#### Software/Web Development & Testing

* Main Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java
* Frameworks: Rails, Sinatra
* TDD: RSpec, Capybara, JUnit, Jasmine
* OOP Principles such as SOLID and DRY
* Wireframe/Layout a website or web application
* Write HTML and CSS from scratch
* Take a PSD and turn it into a working website
* Add interactivity to a website with Javascript(or JQuery)
* Work comfortably with a version control system(Github)
* Deploy a website to a website host(Heroku)

#### Problem Solving

  *  Aim to simplify complex tasks/concepts by breaking them down into smaller/simpler units. I use plain English to solve a problem at an abstract level first, then translate into code, test-driving throughout the development.
  *  Use of diagrams to blueprint systems/concepts to more easily reason over them.
  *  Tackle problem solving with focus and calm; ability to take a step back and take a fresh approach whenever necessary.
  *  Scanning, identifying, diagnosing and resolving problems, errors and bugs in software.


#### Clean Code

  *  Take pride in the code I produce and always ask myself if it could be improved, more efficient and easier to understand.
  *  Designing and writing programs as interactions among functions that each perform a single well-defined function, and which have minimal side-effect interaction between them.
  *  Attention to detail, including choice of names. I carefully pick the clearest, most descriptive and least ambiguous name I can think of, trying to put myself in the shoes of noobs.


  #### Communication

  * Coordinating with your team members and peers about the nitty-gritty, with the goal of developing the product.
  * Discuss technical options with your team members and colleagues, ensuring that my point gets across.
  * Teach a colleague or friend about a great technology/practice/whatever I am using and they should too.
  * We are not isolated from each other. We must constantly share knowledge and best practices.
